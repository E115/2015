Find inline assignment for this week. This assignment is due before Friday 4.30
PM, 11/06. 

-----------------------------

Implement a class definition for a vending machine that dispenses at least 4
different drinks. For each drink, it keeps track of inventory (how much left)
as well as price of that item. Our lecture code showed an example of handling
one drink; your assignment is to extend that to 4 drinks. In addition to
dispensing the drink, there must be options to refill when item runs out and
change prices.

Create a class definition with aforementioned properties. Next, use this class
to define an object in in the main() function. Present a menu using while(1)
and switch statements to let a user pick a drink of choice, and perform a
financial transaction to purchase that drink.

name on a blank screen.
