Write a C++ program using variables, if-else and for-loops that asks the user for a number, N, and prints the first N numbers of the Fibonacci series. For example, if the user inputs “8”, the program prints 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13; i.e., the first eight numbers of the series. You are encouraged to read more about the Fibonacci series on the web.

Check+ or more.  Write a program using for loops with less than 3 “cout” statements in your code to print the following pattern:

```*

***

*****
