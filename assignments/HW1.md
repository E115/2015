  Write a C++ program that performs the following sequence of events in the same order as noted below:
  1. Prompt the user to enter two integer numbers, one after the another. Store these two numbers in two separate variables (much like what we did during lecture).
  2. Next, print the sum, difference, and product of these two numbers back to the user. For example, if the user entered 5 and 3, the program should print that the sum is 8, difference is 2 and the product is 15.
  3. Next, repeat the sequence of steps above using floating point numbers instead. In other words, create two floating point variables in your program. Promt the user to enter two fractional values. Store these two values in your variables. Print the sum, difference, and product of these two values on screen.
  4. Feel free to use as many temporary variables as needed. For example, to accomplish task 2, you might want to create variables such as 'int sum' or ' int product' to store the sum and product, respectively.
