Design and implement a grade calculator that displays the final grade based on
a number of parameters. Grades are calculated based on 5 assignment scores, 2
midterm scores and one final test score. The program routines asks for: (i)
assignment score for each of the 5 assignments, (ii) midterm 1 and 2 scores,
and (iii) final test score. It then calculates the final aggregate score based
the weightage for each of these components; your program must ask for these
weightages from the user. Based on the final aggregate score, a grade of either
A, B, C or D is printed on screen.

There is an additional clause to calculating grade. If a student takes the
final exam in the first week, and gets more than 70, the student get's an A
regardless of assignments and midterms. Your program should be able pose
questions to capture all the abovestated information about a student and
display the correct final grade on screen.  

Check+ or more: To get bonus points, make the grade calculator as realistic as
possible. Assume nothing about the number of assignments or midterms, instead
let the user tell you these things by posing questions and understanding how
grading works for that particular course.
