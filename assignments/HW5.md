Design and implement a calculator that supports all four basic functionalities
like add, subtract, divide and multiply using functions. Specifically, perform
the following: 

- Use functions to perform all these operations 

- Your functions must "return" the result of the computation back to the main()
  program, which displays this on screen. 

  - Use a while(1) and switch to create a "menu" like interfact that allows the
    user to enter two numbers, and pick an operation of choice. 

    Check+ or more: Design a calculator that takes as an input a free form
    expression the user can type, such as "2+3*5", and prints the result on
    screen. No menu, no interface, it simply waits for an expressions and gets
    you the result. It's important to preserve the order of operations to do
    this. For example, 2+3*5 should amount to 17 and not 15, and its important
    to do the multiplication before addition.
